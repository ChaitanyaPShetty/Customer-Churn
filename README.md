# Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This project focuses on developing and training Machine Learning models to predict customer churn. By analyzing customer data, we aim to identify patterns that indicate a customer's likelihood of leaving the service. This information can then be used to implement proactive retention strategies.

## Key Objectives

* Develop and train predictive models for customer churn.
* Enhance model accuracy through Exploratory Data Analysis and hyperparameter tuning.
* Improve model efficiency by implementing feature selection and dimensionality reduction techniques.
* Clean and preprocess data, including handling missing values.

## Methodology

1.  **Data Preprocessing:**
    * Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset, handling missing values.
2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
    * Performed EDA to understand the data distribution and identify potential features influencing customer churn.
3.  **Feature Engineering:**
    * Employed Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) for feature selection.
    * Utilized Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction.
4.  **Model Development:**
    * Developed and trained Machine Learning models including:
        * Logistic Regression
        * Random Forest
        * XGBoost
5.  **Model Tuning:**
    * Performed hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance and enhance accuracy.
6.  **Model Evaluation:**
    * Evaluated the trained models using appropriate metrics to assess their effectiveness in predicting customer churn.

## Technologies Used

* Python
* Scikit-learn
* Pandas
* NumPy
* XGBoost

## Results

The project successfully developed and trained Machine Learning models capable of identifying customer churn patterns. Through EDA, feature selection, and hyperparameter tuning, the models' accuracy and efficiency were significantly improved.

## Future Improvements

* Explore more advanced Machine Learning algorithms and deep learning techniques.
* Implement real-time churn prediction using streaming data.
* Develop a user-friendly interface for visualizing churn predictions and insights.
* Implement A/B testing for various retention strategies.
