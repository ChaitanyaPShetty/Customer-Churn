## Key Objectives

* Develop and train predictive models for customer churn.
* Enhance model accuracy through Exploratory Data Analysis and hyperparameter tuning.
* Improve model efficiency by implementing feature selection and dimensionality reduction techniques.
* Clean and preprocess data, including handling missing values.

## Data and Methodology

1.  **Data Preprocessing:**
    * Dataset: 99,999 records, 226 features (demographics, billing, usage, etc.).
    * Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset, handling missing values.
    Preprocessing: Feature selection (PCA, RFE), class balancing (SMOTE), and normalization.
2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
    * Performed EDA to understand the data distribution and identify potential features influencing customer churn.
3.  **Feature Engineering:**
    * Employed Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) for feature selection.
    * Utilized Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction.
4.  **Model Development:**
    * Developed and trained Machine Learning models including:
